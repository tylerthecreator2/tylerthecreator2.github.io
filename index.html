        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease two 9-inch round pans. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Beat shortening and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar until very light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Make cocoa paste with red food coloring. (To do that, simply crush the cocoa into a liquid with the food coloring and wait for it to solidify). Add to creamed mixture. Mix salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and buttermilk together. Add the Sifted AP flour to the batter, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Mix soda and vinegar and gently fold into cake batter. <strong> Don't beat or stir the batter after this point.</strong> <br>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire rack. <br>
<strong>Step 5 To make Icing:</strong> Cook 5 Tablespoons of flour and milk over low heat until thick, stirring contantly. <strong>Let cool completely.</strong> While mixture cools, beat 1 cup sugar, butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency.  Frost cake layers when completely cool.

<p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Place half the grounf beef on a sheet of plastic wrap. Pat it into a rectangular shape, about 8 1/2 inches thick, and 4 inches wide. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the beef into a log, using the plastic wrap as a guide. Season with more salt and pepper. Wrap the plastic tightly around the log and twist both ends tight. Pat gently to slightly flatten. Repeat with remaining ground beef. <br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove the burger dogs from the plastic wrap and place on the grill, perpendicular to the grates. Cook until burgers are browned but still pink inside, 4 to 5 minutes, flip, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Place a slice of cheese on each burger dog and grill to medium doneness (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F/60 degrees C). Remove and rest 3 to 4 minutes. <br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Toast  hot dog buns on the grill and spread each with 2 teaspoons of mayonesa. Place the burger dog on each bun and spread with the one tablespoon of ketchup on top.
